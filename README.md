# Elen2006_Micro_Processors_2019

This project is done in Assembly, and using a Arduino Uno micro-processor. Other key components are an ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor and seven-segment-displays.
The Project is to create a game where a player must place their hand in a corresponding region, on a board, based on a number displayed on the seven-segment-displays. The HC-SR04 will detected if the region is correct based on distance.
